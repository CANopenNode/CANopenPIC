# CANopenPIC

CANopenPIC is a CANopen stack running on PIC microcontrollers.
It is based on [CANopenNode](https://github.com/CANopenNode/CANopenNode),
which is an opensource [CANopen](http://can-cia.org/) Stack
([CiA301](http://can-cia.org/standardization/technical-documents)) and
is included as a git submodule.

## Using on PIC32, dsPIC33, PIC24 and dsPIC30
Visit [Microchip](http://www.microchip.com/) and Install MplabX IDE,
XC32 C compiler for PIC32 or XC16 C compiler for others.
Works on Linux, Mac or Windows.
Open Project, build and program your microcontroller.
Program is tested on Explorer16 board from Microchip, devices
PIC32MX795F512L and dsPIC33FJ256GP710.
CAN transciever chip is soldered to the Explorer16 board.
